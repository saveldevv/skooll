### If you have only an extension
1. Locate your extension id by clicking the extension icon in the top right of your browser ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93336301/236832184-d760a12b-bc33-45d0-9b27-d8ba6528eb7f.png), find your extension, click the 3 dots, then click "Manage Extension". Copy everything after `chrome://extensions?id=`. That is your extension id.

2. Create 2 new bookmarks IN YOUR BOOKMARK BAR, one named `kill` with a URL of `chrome://kill` and one named `hang` with a URL of `chrome://hang`.
3. Open a new tab and go to `chrome-extension://yourextensionidhere/manifest.json` but replace "yourextensionidhere" with the id from earlier.
4. Okay, you're going to want to remember this entire step and do it quickly. Click the `kill` bookmark from earlier and quickly spam the `hang` bookmark and the reload button on your keyboard for about 3-ish seconds.
5. Pin the current tab (optional). **DO NOT CLOSE THIS TAB OR IT WILL STOP WORKING. THE TAB WILL RELOAD FOREVER.**
6. You have done basic LTMEAT! Enjoy your freedom.


### If you have an extension AND a wifi blocker (if above didnt work alone)
1. Complete the [SkoolVPN tutorial](https://bit.ly/skoolvpn).
2. Complete all the steps in the "If you have only an extension" tutorial. You are done, but you will need to reconnect to the VPN every time you close your chromebook.

### Final Notes
* Do not close the killed tab. The tab will forever reload, ignore this.
* You will need to redo the tutorial if your chromebook gets shut down. (E.g it dies or you sign out)
* You will need to reconnect to the VPN every time you close your chromebook. (I know this is annoying, sorry, but it is necessary.)
